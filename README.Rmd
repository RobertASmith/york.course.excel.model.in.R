## Installation

You can install the released version of york.course.excel.model.in.R from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("york.course.excel.model.in.R")
```

## Background

This is an R implementation of the Excel model titled
_Markov Modelling and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis for Cost-Effectiveness Modelling of Health Care Interventions_
by Andrew Briggs, Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford.

The model outlined is the spreadsheet was used to illustrate the principles of Markov modelling and probabilistic sensitivity analysis in the following two papers:			

* Briggs A, Sculpher M.  Introducing Markov models for economic evaluation. PharmacoEconomics 1998; 13(4): 397-409.			
* Briggs AH.  Handling uncertainty in cost-effectiveness models.PharmacoEconomics 2000 (forthcoming).			

The model is made available for non-commercial teaching purposes only.
