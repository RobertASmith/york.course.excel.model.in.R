The package `york.course.excel.model.in.R` is an R implementation of the MS Excel Markov model, titled
_Markov Modelling and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis for Cost-Effectiveness Modelling of Health Care Interventions_
by Andrew Briggs, Health Economics Research Centre, University of Oxford.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `york.course.excel.model.in.R` from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("n8thangreen/york.course.excel.model.in.R")
```

## Background

The model outlined in the spreadsheet was used to illustrate the principles of Markov modelling and probabilistic sensitivity analysis in the following two papers:			

> Briggs A, Sculpher M.  Introducing Markov models for economic evaluation. PharmacoEconomics 1998; 13(4): 397-409.

> Briggs AH.  Handling uncertainty in cost-effectiveness models.PharmacoEconomics 2000 (forthcoming).			

The model is made available for non-commercial teaching purposes only.			


## Key files

* `scripts/markov_model.R` - Model set-up, simulation and cost-effectiveness analysis.
* `R/p_matrix_cycle.R` - Updates the transition probability matrix at each cycle depending on the cohort ages and cycle number.
