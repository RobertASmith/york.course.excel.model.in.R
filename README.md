The package `york.course.excel.model.in.R` is an R implementation of the
MS Excel Markov model, titled *Markov Modelling and Probabilistic
Sensitivity Analysis for Cost-Effectiveness Modelling of Health Care
Interventions* by Andrew Briggs, Health Economics Research Centre,
University of Oxford.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `york.course.excel.model.in.R`
from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("n8thangreen/york.course.excel.model.in.R")
```

## Background

The model outlined in the spreadsheet was used to illustrate the
principles of Markov modelling and probabilistic sensitivity analysis in
the following two papers:

> Briggs A, Sculpher M. Introducing Markov models for economic
> evaluation. PharmacoEconomics 1998; 13(4): 397-409.  
> Briggs AH. Handling uncertainty in cost-effectiveness
> models.PharmacoEconomics 2000 (forthcoming).

The model is made available for non-commercial teaching purposes only.
